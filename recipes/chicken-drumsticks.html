    <h3>Description</h3>
<p>These smoked chicken legs are so versatile and easy! I like to use applewood chips or other fruit woods, but maple is also a great choice. Use your favorite BBQ rub. 
    Letting the legs air-dry in the refrigerator overnight, combined with a higher smoking temperature, helps prevent rubbery skin that is common when smoking chicken. Serve with your favorite BBQ sauce, if desired.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>12 chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>⅓ cup BBQ rub</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place drumsticks on a rack over a drip tray or baking sheet. Air-dry in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an electric smoker to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C) and add wood chips according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>Brush drumsticks lightly with vegetable oil. Place drumsticks in a resealable plastic bag and sprinkle with the rub. Toss to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Place drumsticks on the rack in the smoker. Smoke until chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 2 hours.
        </li>
    </ol>
